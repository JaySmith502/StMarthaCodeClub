James Key is primary teacher resource for this club
What follows are some notes while researching best practices for creating club and plans
None of these notes are structured guidelines, merely what I"ve found online as best practices

Idea is to begin club shortly after Winter break, since students will have completed "Hour of Code" in December.

* 5-6 students per parent/volunteer/teacher--How many computers/workstations are available
* Allow those with notebooks, chromebooks, laptops to use them instead of school computers?
* SCRATCH.MIT.EDU seems to be one of the most popular (and free) resources for code clubs
* 8-10 weeks is the normal range for clubs like this, it gives enough time to both learn and complete a project
* One hour immediately following school once per week
* At the outset the kids need to engage with the programming, not be given a lecture on how it works or anything like that
* If possible have them pre-register on whatever platform (Scratch, e.g.) will be used
* Provide teacher with master list of signin and passwords, to avoid interruption due to forgotten passwords
* Have kids blog about experiences? Use a central platform they log into?
* No grading, you get out of it how much you want to put in (just like real programming)
* Have a "Demo Day" at the end where club goers can share their projects with family
* Emphasize to students NOT to compare their progress or results with anybody else
* Are there any restrictions on classroom computers (Youtube, Vimeo, e.g.) that would prevent use of Scratch or require a workaround?
* Ideas on year to year progression--4/5 grade use Scratch, 6/7 grade use CodeAcademy to learn HTML and CSS, 8th graders who stick it out do Javascript


* Google CS works with Scratch but also provides direction and lesson plans as well as online presence for students
* St Agnes is listed as a Louisville Code Club on Google CS, would be good to get to know who runs their program
* Google CS First is set up in 8 session tracks, looks like Gaming would be a good one to pursue
